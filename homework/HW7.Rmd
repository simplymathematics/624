```{r}
library(mlbench)
library(caret)
library(earth)
set.seed(200)
trainingData <- mlbench.friedman1(200, sd = 1)
df = as.data.frame(trainingData)
head(df)
trainingData$x <- data.frame(trainingData$x)
featurePlot(trainingData$x, trainingData$y)
```

```{r}
testData <- mlbench.friedman1(5000, sd = 1)
testData$x <- data.frame(testData$x)

```

```{r}
knnModel <- train(x = trainingData$x, 
                  y = trainingData$y, 
                  method = "knn", preProc =                             c("center", "scale"), 
                  tuneLength = 10)
plot(knnModel$results$RMSE)
```
The minimized RMSE appears to happen around 6 cluster, although 5 and 7 give similar results.

```{r}
library(earth)
mars <- earth(trainingData$x, trainingData$y)
```
